# Coin Quest Empire üéÆ

yo wassup, this is my coin clicker game lol. made it with react and typescript cuz why not

## what is this thing?

Basically its a coin clicking game where u click to get coins and buy upgrades and stuff. pretty simple

### Features and stuff

- **Click to earn coins** - just click the button and watch ur coins go brrrr
- **Quests system** - complete challenges to get bonus coins, got like 10 quests rn
- **Upgrade shop** - buy upgrades to make ur clicks worth more coins per click
- **Passive income generators** - buy these and they make coins for u automatically even when ur not clicking
- **Save system** - ur progress gets auto-saved every 5 seconds so u dont lose anything when u reload
- **Modern ui** - revamped the whole thing with glassmorphism and gradients, looks pretty sick ngl
- **Cute review popup** - after 30 seconds a little star appears asking for a good review lol

## how to run this

```bash
# install dependencies first
npm install

# run the dev server
npm run dev

# should open on localhost:5174 or something like that
```

## tech stack i made it up on

- **react 19.1.1** - for the ui components and stuff
- **typescript** - cuz types are cool i guess
- **vite** - super fast build tool, love it
- **localStorage** - for saving ur game progress locally
